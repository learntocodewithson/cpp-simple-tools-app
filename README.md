# Problem
 - write a c++ program by function method to do FOLLOWING ask the user for choices (what do you want) (a) sum of two value.. (b)  factorial of a number..(c) table of a number (d) even number from 41
 to 100 (e) prime number

# Specs
- create a lists of different function methods
- OOP

# The Flow

# Screen 1
 - What do you want? 
 - 1.) Sum of two value
 - 2.) Factorial of a number
 - 3.) Table of a number
 - 4.) Even number from 41 to 100
 - 5.) Prime number
 - 6.) Sum of numbers when prime number is found
 - 7.) Guess odd or even number
 - 8.) Reverse a string
 - 9.) Sort students by marks
 - 10.) Exit

# 1. Sum of the value
 - Enter number 1: 1
 - Enter number 2: 2
 - The sum of 1 and 2 is 3.
# 2. Factorial of a number
 - Enter the factorial number: 5
 - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
# 3. Table of a number
 - Enter a base number: 7
 - 7 x 1 = 7
 - 7 x 2 = 14
 - ...
# 4. Even number from 41 to 100
  - Enter starting point: 2
  - Enter end point: 100
  - 2 4 6 ... 100
# 5. Prime number
  - Enter a number: 1
  - 1 is a prime number
  - 1 is not prime number
# 6. Sum of numbers when prime number is found
  - (in a loop)
  - Enter a number: 4
  - if 4 is a prime?
   - if yes, exit the loop and total all previous inputs
   - if no, continue looping while asking the new number
# 7. Guess odd or even number
  - Enter a number: 4
  - 4 is even number
  - 3 is odd number
# 8. Reverse a string
  - Enter a string: Hello
  - olleH
# 9. Sort students by marks
  - (loop: limit 10)
  - Enter your name:
  - Enter your mark:
  - Display: (decending by default)
   - 1. Name1 - mark1
   - 2. Name2 - mark2
